### IMS213

simple tower defense demo
Note that there is just one monster, one round of incursion, and two towers, both of which shoot the same ammo.
This is not a "playable" demo, it just runs automatically, but it should give you a good idea of how to (for example):
1.  Create "hitpoint" readouts on the monsters;
2.  Turn and point tower guns;
3.  Aim at nearest creature and allow gun to cool off;
4.  Use paths to control creatures;
5.  Change speed as creatures are damaged;

and so on.
